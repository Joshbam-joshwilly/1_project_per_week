# Weekly Project Challenge ðŸš€

Feel free to contribute to this repository or use it as a playground for your coding practice!

## How to Contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Click on the "Fork" button on the GitHub repository's page. This creates a copy of the repository under the contributor's GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Joshbam-joshwilly/1_project_per_week.git
    ```

3. **Add Upstream Remote:** Add the original repository (upstream) as a remote to keep your local copy in sync with the main project.

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Joshbam-joshwilly/1_project_per_week.git
    ```

4. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch in your name.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```

5. **Make Changes:** Make the necessary changes to the code.

6. **Commit and Push Changes:**
   
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```

7. **Pull Changes from Upstream:** Before creating a pull request, it's essential to pull the latest changes from the main repository.

    ```bash
    git pull upstream main
    ```

8. **Resolve Conflicts (if any)

9. **Push Changes to Fork:** Once conflicts are resolved, push the changes to your forked repository.

    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```

10. **Create a Pull Request:** Finally, create a pull request on the GitHub website from your branch to the main repository.


Let's build something amazing together! ðŸŒŸ
